Working with Sublime is nice. I can see how advantageous it is to switch between languages. Something I 
found particularly surprising was the proprietary nature of GIFs (which prompted the creation of PNGs)

In 3D modeling, there are a host of "free" programs. Some are free to collect data; others are 
subsidizing a market share bump, only to regularly remove functionality and ask for payment. Autodesk's 
Fusion 360 is a notable example, though I think they've done this transition really well. 

I often trawl the internet and find discussions complaining about how Apple products are overpriced 
fancy things. What I like about Apple is that I want my money to go towards privacy. I want to pay for 
privacy. Now, I'm not a fool--I'm aware that what Apple says and what they do behind closed doors is 
different. It did seem like privacy was something that mattered, if only at some point. 

One question: do I have to git init each time I'm in Terminal? Or, do I simply have to navigate to the 
folder and begin edits?

In Sublime Text, is tab spacing important? Currently, it's set to 4. And, in the video, 
'doctype' wasn't colored, but 'DOCTYPE' was colored when typing html > tab--do we need to 
capitalize 'doctype'? - WE SET TO 3

In my mind, libraries, junkyards, thrift stores, and second hand 
bookstores are one and the same.
