Working with Sublime is nice. I can see how advantageous it is to switch between languages. Something I 
found particularly surprising was the proprietary nature of GIFs (which prompted the creation of PNGs) 
and RTFs. The video about VS Code reinforced this struggle. 

In 3D modeling, there are a host of "free" programs. Some are free to collect data; others are 
subsidizing a market share bump, only to regularly remove functionality and ask for payment. Autodesk's 
Fusion 360 is a notable example, though I think they've done this transition really well. 

I often trawl the internet and find discussions complaining about how Apple products are overpriced 
fancy things. What I like about Apple is that I want my money to go towards privacy. I want to pay for 
privacy. Now, I'm not a fool--I'm aware that what Apple says and what they do behind closed doors is 
different. It did seem like privacy was something that mattered, if only at some point. 

One question: do I have to git init each time I'm in Terminal? Or, do I simply have to navigate to the 
folder and begin edits?

Where do files go when we 'rm' them? They're not in my trash can. 

"A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a 
closing tag."

In Sublime Text, is tab spacing important? Currently, it's set to 4. And, in the video, 
'doctype' wasn't colored, but 'DOCTYPE' was colored when typing html > tab--do we need to 
capitalize 'doctype'? - WE SET TO 3

In my mind, libraries, junkyards, thrift stores, and second hand 
bookstores are one and the same.

It's been a couple of days since I last updated here. I think there were 
some lingering anxieties about git commits, and I think the main way to 
address this is to simply do this more often. 

### Explain your FTP experience

Working with the FTP was an exercise that proved troublesome. At first, I 
was unable to login, but that was quickly addressed by asking Derek for 
some help. I'm not entirely sure what happened, but he was able to fix it 
on his end.  

I added my files, then somehow doubled some files outside of my folder. 
Fearing I'd break the whole thing, I slowly removed some items and brought 
it back to normal. 

More issues presented themselves with my file paths. I kept getting 404 
errors, so I rechecked my index.html file and cleared that up. 

I'm nervous about breaking it. I have a feeling I'll definitely break it.

Chrome dev tools can adjust CSS on the fly! Whoa! And, PE's lighthouse results are impressive. Why isn't Progressive Web App set up? What is PWA, anyway?

### Metadata

What would my metadata be? Image logo? I'm a designer looking for work? 

Rich data, smart rich sharing assets are important, across all platforms. There are times when you cannot control how the metadata looks, but you can test.

Is there a way to refresh Chrome Dev Tools when navigating to another site? I found that whe nusing Lighthouse, the prior site's results remained, and I had to close out the tool. THERE IS!

I confused the hell out of myself with file name conventions and git versioning. I have this feeling I’m taking a file naming habit and making things more complicated with regard to version control, and wanted to know what y’all think.

At the moment, I’m playing around with my portal file. Each day I work on it, I’ll save a file with the date:

- 2022-10-06-web-portal.html
- 2022-10-07-web-portal.html
- 2022-10-11-web-portal.html

Is saving versions something I should be doing? Am I doing double duty, something that git version control handles? Or, is this helpful for humans scanning/tracking files down the line?
Something tells me I’m bound to select an outdated version in the future and waste time trying to chase down an error that could be mitigated with a change in behavior.
I’m confused. (edited) 

I’m no longer confused!

Ohhh, boy, yep, this date conventions is something I definitely won’t be doing with things that can be updated with git.
If I kept changing the file name, I’d have to update the index.html file to reflect the newest change. I didn’t even think of that, and it only clicked when I deleted earlier versions of the file and received a 404 error.
Once that error appeared, I looked at the url, manually entered the newest file name, and all was well. That’s real, real bad.
I think from here on out I’ll pick a file name and leave versioning to git!

So, is the process save files > git committ > update transmit?
