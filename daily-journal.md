Working with Sublime is nice. I can see how advantageous it is to switch between languages. Something I 
found particularly surprising was the proprietary nature of GIFs (which prompted the creation of PNGs) 
and RTFs. The video about VS Code reinforced this struggle. 

In 3D modeling, there are a host of "free" programs. Some are free to collect data; others are 
subsidizing a market share bump, only to regularly remove functionality and ask for payment. Autodesk's 
Fusion 360 is a notable example, though I think they've done this transition really well. 

I often trawl the internet and find discussions complaining about how Apple products are overpriced 
fancy things. What I like about Apple is that I want my money to go towards privacy. I want to pay for 
privacy. Now, I'm not a fool--I'm aware that what Apple says and what they do behind closed doors is 
different. It did seem like privacy was something that mattered, if only at some point.
